## What is Helm?

Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that makes it easy to define, install, and upgrade even the most complex Kubernetes applications. It uses charts, which are packages of pre-configured Kubernetes resources, to simplify the deployment process.

## Getting Started

### Installing Helm

Before you can start using Helm, you need to install it on your local machine.
**On macOS:**

### Initializing Helm

Once Helm is installed, you should initialize it to set up the necessary components.

## Basic Helm Commands

### Chart Installation

To install a Helm chart onto your Kubernetes cluster, use the `helm install` command. Here's an example of installing a WordPress chart:

### Chart Upgrades

Helm allows you to easily upgrade your deployed charts as new versions become available. Here's how to upgrade a chart:

### Chart Removal

When you're done with a Helm chart, you can remove it from your cluster using the `helm uninstall` command.

## Creating Your Own Helm Charts

Creating custom Helm charts is a powerful way to package and deploy your Kubernetes applications. Stay tuned for detailed tutorials on creating your own charts!

## Advanced Helm Usage

### Helm Repositories

Helm allows you to manage repositories of pre-packaged charts. You can add, update, and search for charts from these repositories. Here's how to work with Helm repositories:

### Helm Templates

Helm templates are a powerful feature that allows you to customize your charts before deployment. Learn how to use Helm templates effectively:
